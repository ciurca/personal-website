## TL;DR

Choose your identity, not your goal.

Each habit has 4 stages: 
1. Cue
2. Craving
3. Response
4. Reward

1 & 2 = Problem phase (you see something and you want the reward)
3 & 4 = Solution phase (you do something and get the reward, or at least try)

To build good habits use these 4 rules based on the stages:
1. Make it Obvious (cue)
2. Make it Attractive (craving)
3. Make it Easy (response)
4. Make it Satisfying (reward)

To break bad habits inverse the rules above.
