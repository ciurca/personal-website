## TL;DR

It's **safe** to say that this book came in at the right time in my life. I'm currently in my last year of high school and I'm not sure what I want to pursue. Before reading the book I thought that developing skill is critical in your career and that whatever I end up pursuing in university I must develop rare skill & abilities.

This book confirms my theory. Most people like myself don't have a preexisting passion that they could match to a career (and actually make money whilst pursuing it), so the advice *follow your passions* is flawed. You should do things that allow you to develop rare & valuable skills that differentiate you from your peers. This way, you don't worry about *making the right decision* when at a crossroads, just choose the option that yields most opportunity to become **so good they can't ignore you**. (a lot of times both options are similar in that regard, they both give you opportunity to grow.

If you'd have to choose the most valuable concept from this book it would probably be the ***career capital theory***. When you start out in your career you don't have any career capital. The better you get and the more skill you develop, the more you acquire career capital. You can trade in your career capital for more autonomy or a mission. The latter requires a lot more career capital and you need to be at the cutting edge of your field, that's where missions become more visible.

# The 4 Rules

This book is structured in 4 main rules:

1. Don't Follow Your Passion
2. Be So Good They Can't Ignore You
3. Turn Down A Promotion
4. Think Small, Act Big

### RULE #1: Don't Follow Your Passion

*Working right trumps finding the right work.*

In the beginning of your career, work won't be that great. Your tasks will probably pretty boring, you don't have a say in how your day is structured and the pay will not match the CEO's salary. But that's all right.

When your starting out, you have little to none career capital built up. You first have to prove yourself before trying to acquire more control over the projects you're working on and when you get in the office. Maybe you'll feel that this field isn't for you and that you made a poor decision. That's mainly because you don't have the traits that define great work such as:

1. Autonomy: control over the projects your working on and how your day is structured;
2. Competence: being very good at what you do;
3. Relatedness: feeling connected to the people you're working with;

These traits have a *[multiplying by zero effect](https://fs.blog/2016/08/multiplicative-systems/).* You can feel that you're very good at what you're doing and love the people you're working with, but if you don't really have a say in the projects you're working on, it's not going to fulfill you.

Apply this formula: (use 1 if you've got the characteristic, 0 if you don't)

$$\autonomy\*competence\*relatedness
