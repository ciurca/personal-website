I started this 30 day challenge in order to improve my typing speed. What I didn't consider was that you first had to actually know how to type properly before being very fast.

What do I mean by typing properly? Well using all your fingers and using them for the appropriate keys. Before this experiment, I used around 4 of my fingers most of the time, and I also used them randomly, however I felt. Now, don't get me wrong, I had a pretty good speed, I could write around 65-70 word per minute, and I didn't need to look at the keyboard all the time. But I wanted to **type properly**.

This is how you're supposed to use & place your fingers.

Each finger is assigned certain keys on the keyboard to ensure that all of them are used.

You should also be able to type without looking at the keyboard. 

In all, you want to become a [touch typist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing).
