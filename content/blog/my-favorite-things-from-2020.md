In this article I'll uncover the best things I've learned and used throughout 2020. This article will be divided into Productivity and Lifestyle.

## Productivity

### Tools

* [**ForestApp** ](https://www.forestapp.cc/)(study, work): this is the app I use to keep track of the time I've spent being focused. You can use different trees and even plant a real one if you acquire enough coins! I highly recommend this app, and I've even bought the premium version since it was really cheap and I literally use it everyday. If you want to sign up, here's my referral code: **6GPT8J6SG**.
* **[EggTimer](https://e.ggtimer.com/)** (study, work, life): the easiest to use website for a timer. I personally use it for the Pomodoro feature when I'm studying since it automatically starts the break timer and reminds me to get back to work once it's up. The site works like this: you enter e.ggtimer.com/desiredtimer(for example, for a 5 minute and 30 second timer, just use e.ggtimer.com/5minutes30seconds)
* **[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)** (learning): you've most definitely heard of Anki, it's probably the best spaced-repetition software out there. I'm using Anki for everything I'm learning. It's **free** and it works perfectly. Make sure to make an Ankiweb account, so you can sync your decks!
* **[Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/)** (reading): I've started reading a lot more articles because of Instapaper. Whenever there's something on the internet that I might wanna read later, I just save it in Instapaper. It's instant (get it?) and it's cross platform. You can even send articles directly to your Kindle, but I haven't tried that yet.
* **[Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/radu6)** (reading, notes): Whenever there's something I want to highlight, I do it with Readwise. It connects to almost anything from Kindle, Twitter to Instapaper (or Pocket if you use that). There are loads of apps that work with it. You can export your notes in apps like Notion, Evernote or even Roam. Also, it sends you daily a mail with your highlights, or you can check them in the app. Best of all, you can use [my link](https://readwise.io/welcome/sync) to get an extra month!
* **[Google Keep](http://keep.google.com/)** (notes): It's just notes... Free and very intuitive. The dictate feature and location-based reminders are phenomenal.

### Lifehacks

* **Uninstalling social media apps from your phone**. Yes, you can live without Instagram or Twitter installed. I cut down on social media usage dramatically using this *lifehack*. If I really need to check any of these sites, I just use the browser. Even Instagram's version works great in the browser. Nowadays, I only install the apps if I need a specific feature that the site version doesn't offer.
* **Pomodoro sessions**. 25 minute focused work, followed by a 5 minute break. It can do wonders in your work life. EggTimer's Pomodoro feature is great and I highly recommend it.
* **Setting a block for social media usage**. Even though I have uninstalled social media apps from my phone, I still like to check it. Now, I usually do it late in the day, after I achieved everything I set out to do. I used to surf Instagram or Twitter in my 5 minute Pomodoro break, but I found that doesn't mix well with studying.
