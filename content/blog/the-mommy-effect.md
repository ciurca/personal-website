If you have lots of ideas and you want honest feedback from people close to you, I’ve got the tactic just for you.

Some time ago I was at an event where an entrepreneur spoke. He pointed out that there is something that happens when we lay out our ideas to people close to us. He called it **the mommy effect**.

The premise is that if you are going to share a business idea with your mother, she’s not going to have the heart to tell you that it sucks. It’s hard to be completely honest with someone close to you, especially if they are passionate about the idea. If you make it to be your idea, it gets personal.

The solution if you want honest feedback? **Don’t tell them it’s your idea.** Tell them you’ve heard it from someone else or that you read it from some guy or gal on the internet. Then they’ll be honest. Maybe a bit too honest. Family & friends won’t feel bad bashing someone else’s idea.

One downside to this tactic is that you can’t (and in my opinion shouldn’t) use it too often on people close to you. It’s gonna be a bit weird if you tell them about an idea someone else had and then claim it’s yours if they praise it. Use this tactic at your own peril.

PS: I’m taking suggestions for names, since googling “the mommy effect” isn’t what you’d expect if you were interested in this bit of advice.
