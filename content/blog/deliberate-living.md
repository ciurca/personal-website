In *So Good They Can't Ignore You*, Cal Newport talks about the importance of deliberate practice in developing your skills. This isn't a new idea, especially in the productivity sphere, we know that you have to be mindful about your work in order to get the wanted results. Deliberate practice will result in a lot of strain, that's why a lot of people don't work this way. It's uncomfortable.

A lot of specific concepts such as deliberate practice can be applied in different parts of life. Instead of deliberate practice that's specific to productivity, we can think about **deliberate living** that can be applied to life as a whole.

I often times catch myself doing the same things socially because it's comfortable in the moment, even though it can hurt my relationships with others in the long-term.
