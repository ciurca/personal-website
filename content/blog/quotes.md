This is a list of quotes (and some notes) that I'm constantly updating, taken from different things that I’ve read, listened or watched. I believe that a quote gives you an insight into **how and what that particular person thinks**.

If a quote doesn’t necessarily have an author or if it’s a common saying I’ll put **VA** besides it (Various Authors). If you see a quote that you know for a fact has a certain author, you can let me know on Twitter @raduciurca.

Some of these are also notes in the form of quotes, you'll be able to distinguish them.

## The list

VA:

> Nothing costs nothing. 

Aristotle:

> Potters envy potters.

VA (introspection illusion):

> Nothing is more convincing than your own beliefs. 

VA (information bias):

> Forget trying to amass all the data. Do your best to get by with the bare facts.

Julius Caesar:

> People readily believe what they want to believe.

Blaise Pascal:

> All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.

Charlie Munger:

> You have to figure out where you've got an edge. And you have to play within your own **circle of competence**.

Warren Buffet:

> What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact.

John Corry:

> Beware of the people who moralize about great issues; moralizing is easier than facing hard facts.

Kanye West:

> Everything I'm not made me everything I am.

Thomas Sowell:

> Life does not ask us what we want, it presents us with options.

VA:

> It is the quantity dose that makes the poison.

VA:

> Nothing changes if nothing changes.

Marcus Aurelius:

> No one can lose either the past or the future - how could anyone be deprived of what he does not possess? ... It is only the present moment of which either stands to be deprived: and if this is all he has, he cannot lose what he does not have.

Lex Fridman:

> Our intuition about what's hard and easy is really flawed as human beings.

Horace:

> Sapere aude. (Dare to know/Dare to think for yourself!)

Dave Barry:

> Meetings are an addictive, highly self-indulgent activity that corporations and other large organizations habitually engage in only because they cannot actually masturbate.

Chinese proverb:

> Talk doesn't cook rice.

Andy Grove:

> Bad companies are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them.

Bruce Lee:

> Seriously, if you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else; it'll spread over into the rest of your life. It'll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being... There are NO limits. There are plateus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level.

John Danaher:

> Don't listen to what people say. Watch what the best people do.
