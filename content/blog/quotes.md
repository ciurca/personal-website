This is a list of quotes (and some notes) that I'm constantly updating, taken from different things that I’ve read, listened or watched. I believe that a quote gives you an insight into **how and what that particular person thinks**.

If a quote doesn’t necessarily have an author or if it’s a common saying I’ll put **VA** besides it (Various Authors). If you see a quote that you know for a fact has a certain author, you can let me know on Twitter @raduciurca.

Some of these are also notes in the form of quotes, you'll be able to distinguish them.

## The list
VA:

> “Nothing costs nothing.” 

Aristotle:

> "Potters envy potters." 

VA (introspection illusion):

> "Nothing is more convincing than your own beliefs." 

VA (information bias):

> "Forget trying to amass al the data. Do your best to get by with the bare facts."

Julius Caesar:

> "People readily believe what they want to believe."

Blaise Pascal:

> **"All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone."**

Charlie Munger:

> "You have to figure out where you've got an edge. And you have to play within your own **circle of competence**."

Warren Buffet:

> "What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact."

John Corry:

> **"Beware of the people who moralize about great issues; moralizing is easier than facing hard facts."**

Kanye West:

> "Everything I'm not made me everything I am."

Thomas Sowell:

> "Life does not ask us what we want, it presents us with options."

VA:

> "It is the quantity dose that makes the poison."

VA:

> "Nothing changes if nothing changes."

Marcus Aurelius:

> “**No one can lose either the past or the future** - how **could** anyone be deprived of what he does not possess? ... It is only the present moment of which **either** stands to be deprived: and if this is all he has, he cannot **lose** what he does not have.”

Lex Fridman:

>"Our intuition about what's hard and easy is really flawed as human beings."

Horace:

>"Sapere aude." (Dare to know/Dare to think for yourself!)

The list will be continued once I'll find more quotes that are worthy. Until then, you can check out my Twitter {{< target-blank "@raduciurca" "https://twitter.com/raduciurca" >}}, for more thoughts and ideas. We will be **going further**.
