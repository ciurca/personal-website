If you\u0026rsquo;ve started or have been using VIM for some while now, you know that the Escape key has significant value.\nStaying in the home row, also has significant value, so swapping the Escape key with Capslock is the natural thing to do.\nThe Capslock key is more accessible, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to move your whole hand just to press Escape. You can simply use your pinky finger.\nSwapping vs remapping We\u0026rsquo;re swapping the Escape and Capslock key, meaning that if you want to press Escape, you\u0026rsquo;ll now have to press Caps and vice-versa. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen tutorials that remap the Escape key, leaving you with no Caps key, so this method just seemed easier.\nThe way We\u0026rsquo;re going to use the dconf command to swap the two keys.\nSimply run this command in your terminal:\ndconf write /org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options \u0026quot;['caps:swapescape']\u0026quot;  Special note: I found the way of doing this in this comment on this tutorial on how to remap Capslock to Escape.\nMeta Photo by Charles Deluvio on Unsplash ","permalink":"https://raduciurca.com/technica/swapescape/","tags":["vim","ubuntu"],"title":"How to swap the Escape key with Capslock in Ubuntu"},{"categories":null,"contents":"  .content1 { display: flex; } .content1 img { margin-right: 10px; width: 100%; max-width: 100px; height: auto; }   Buy the book The Richest Man in Babylon My rating: 5/5 by George S Clason Amazon US Amazon UK    var resourceUrl = 'https:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/Richest-Man-Babylon-Magic-Story\\/dp\\/1939438632\\/'; console.log(resourceUrl); var amASIN = new RegExp(\"\\/([A-Z0-9]{10})\\/\").exec(resourceUrl)[1]; var imgLink = \"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/P/\" + amASIN + \".jpg\"; document.getElementById('imageASIN').setAttribute(\"src\", imgLink); var ukLink = \"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/\" + amASIN; document.getElementById('ukLink').setAttribute(\"href\", ukLink);  Backstory My brother initially got this book as a Christmas present for me a couple of years back, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t got around reading it for a while. He actually borrowed it and it\u0026rsquo;s still with him till this very day. (my brother lives in the UK, while I live in Romania, so the book had quite a travel adventure)\nSo, I actually read it electronically. I bought it because I it was very cheap on Google Books and I can never let a bargain go to waste.\nMy notes These are all the notes/quotes I\u0026rsquo;ve gathered from The Richest man in Babylon. Mainly quotes, but I\u0026rsquo;ve let some personal comments slip through there.\n Money is plentiful for those who understand the simple laws which govern its acquisition. (~pg 21)\n Having knowledge of money vs having money  A man\u0026rsquo;s wealth is not in the purse he carries. A fat purse quickly empties if there be no golden stream to refill it. Arkad (the actual richest man in Babylon) has an income that constantly keeps his purse full, no matter how liberally he spends. (~pg 27)\n Money comes and goes, but knowledge stays. That\u0026rsquo;s why the best and most secure investment is acquiring wisdom. Will it be through books, online-courses or school, your skills \u0026amp; knowledge can always use a polish.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s going to take time and effort  I decided that if I was to achieve what I desired, time and study would be required. (~pg 32)\n You\u0026rsquo;re not going to build your wealth or your knowledge base overnight. Compound interest is at play here.\nGrowing expenses  That what each of us calls our \u0026lsquo;necessary expenses\u0026rsquo; will always grow to equal our incomes unless we protest to the contrary. (~pg 51)\n Control your desires  All men are burdened with more desires than they can gratify. (~pg 51)\n Learn to control your desires, or else they\u0026rsquo;ll end up controlling you.\nYou make your own luck  Men of Action are favored by the goddess of Good Luck. (~pg 81)\n Yes, luck probably plays a role in the creation of wealth. But there will certainly be no luck coming towards the person that takes no action in the attempt to create wealth. Make your own opportunities.\nYoung, but not stupid  Guided by the wisdom of age and not by the inexperience of youth. (~pg 87)\n You may be young, but it certainly isn\u0026rsquo;t an excuse to be stupid, since wisdom of age is readily available.\nHelp only when it won\u0026rsquo;t break you  If you desire to help thy friend, do so in a way that will not bring thy friend\u0026rsquo;s burdens upon thyself. (~pg 101)\nThen be not swayed by foolish sentiments of obligation to trust thy treasure to any person. If thou wouldst help thy family or thy friends, find other ways than risking the loss of thy treasure. (pg ~110)\n Better safe than sorry  Better a Little Caution than a Great Regret (~pg 111)\n Do you really have freedom?  The soul of a free man looks at life as a series of problems to be solved and solves them, while the soul of a slave whines, \u0026lsquo;What can I do who am but a slave?\u0026rsquo; (~pg 127)\n Don\u0026rsquo;t be too arrogant  Work he could offer in plenty to willing workers, but naught for men who considered themselves too good for work. (~pg 146)\n A lot more opportunities are found your way, but you\u0026rsquo;re probably taking a blind eye to them due to arrogance. Who knows what will come out of it?\nWrapping up Those are most of the quotes I\u0026rsquo;ve really enjoyed, and I hope my comments did them well. If you want to read this book, you can buy it here. (this is a referral link, I get a bit of commsision through each sale)\nI\u0026rsquo;ll leave you with another quote that I thought would give this post a nice ending.\n Thou wert once a piece of soft claw to be pressed and moulded by any hand that touched thee, but now thou art a piece of bronze capable of holding an edge. (~pg 137)\n ","permalink":"https://raduciurca.com/books/richestmaninbabylon/","tags":null,"title":"The Richest Man in Babylon"},{"categories":null,"contents":"First, we need to define what a stupid person is. In his short book \u0026lsquo;The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity\u0026rsquo;, Carlo Cipolla describes a stupid person as follows:\n A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.\n You might think, \u0026lsquo;wait a second that doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any sense, why would anyone cause a loss, while they gain absolutely nothing in return\u0026rsquo;. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t blame you, that\u0026rsquo;s what I originally thought. But think of the times somebody stood in your way when you were trying to be productive, whilst they didn\u0026rsquo;t gain from standing in your way. Stupid people are irrational, unreasonable and unpredictable, that\u0026rsquo;s why it is so hard to reason with them or rather, make sense of their behavior. That\u0026rsquo;s why they\u0026rsquo;re so dangerous.\nOf course, there are a few distinctions to be made. How do you distinct stupid people from the rest? Again, Cipolla offers us 4 main categories in which humans fall. Fig. 1 Click image to enlarge\nAs you can see above, you can categorize people based on their incentives in a certain situation. So, using the graph (fig. 1) we can categorize someone based on their motivations and the way they act:\n Stupid people: counterproductive, they lose something while the other party also loses something Helpless people: naive, they lose something while the other party gains something Intelligent people: contributors, they gain something while making sure the other party gains something as well Bandits: thieves, they gain something while the other party loses something  Here are some practical examples: Fig. 2 Click image to enlarge\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to realize that stupid people aren\u0026rsquo;t concentrated in one social category. You find the same percentage of stupid people among Nobel laureates as you do among blue-collar workers. Just because somebody has a prize or a high function associated to their name doesn\u0026rsquo;t make them intelligent. They are still stupid. Not only they are stupid, but the whole system is ridiculous for rewarding these types of people.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s almost as if modern western society promotes status seeking, not erudition seeking.\nLuckily, stupid people are usually consistent. If they do something intelligent, they normally do it by mistake. So, if they are consistent they should be easy to avoid, once we\u0026rsquo;ve defined them. They should never, and I mean never be making decisions for a whole society. That\u0026rsquo;s another reason top-down, central-planned societies are a big no-no. It\u0026rsquo;s very easy for a stupid person to be elected (by other stupid persons, of course) and make unwise decisions that affect negatively the lives of millions of people.\nIn order to minimize the rise of stupid people in positions of power you need to have certain societal values that promote not the show-off, but the cool-headed rational. Not the stupid, the intelligent. Actions, not words. The entrepreneur, not the rent-seeker (although some might be bandits, a lot of them are very stupid). It\u0026rsquo;s important to make sure that when we take a certain action, we can help others as well. That we are intelligent in that sense.\nAnd so, in conclusion, I\u0026rsquo;m going to leave you with a quote by the great Marcus Aurelius:\n Waste no more time arguing what a good man should be.
