      <description>Image source John set himself a goal of working out daily on a Sunday. He started going to the gym on Monday. This was 3 years ago. He has been going to the gym ever since. He hasn&amp;rsquo;t had a problem with motivation whatsoever. He hasn&amp;rsquo;t missed a day. You know why? Because he&amp;rsquo;s got willpower.
You know what else John is? An imaginary character. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. Nobody has it easy like that.</description>
