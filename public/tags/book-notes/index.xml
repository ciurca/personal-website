      <description>First, we need to define what a stupid person is. In his short book &amp;lsquo;The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity&amp;rsquo;, Carlo Cipolla describes a stupid person as follows:
 A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.
 You might think, &amp;lsquo;wait a second that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense, why would anyone cause a loss, while they gain absolutely nothing in return&amp;rsquo;.</description>
